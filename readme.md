# What is this project?

This project is a web scraper created using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to gather the amount of feedback on specific course pages on [CCGOnline](https://ccgonline.chichester.ac.uk)

## How to run

- When running the program you must use the `--chrome` option to specify your [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) install directory. Do not point this to the .exe, just to the folder

- To run the program you must fill out the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. This file should be placed in the same directory as the .exe file

- When running first run the .exe file with the argument `-h` as this will bring up a help menu
